        <p>ADFastDNS is a high-performance DNS proxy and ad blocker designed for iOS 17 and later, optimized for iPhone and iPad. It leverages DNS over HTTPS (DoH) to provide secure, encrypted DNS resolution while blocking unwanted ads and trackers with customizable filter lists. With a focus on privacy, performance, and ease of use, ADFastDNS is the perfect alternative to traditional VPNs for users who value speed and control.</p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure DNS Proxy</strong>: Uses DNS over HTTPS (DoH) with Cloudflare for encrypted DNS queries (configurable providers coming in future updates).</li>
            <li><strong>Custom DNS Filtering</strong>: Block ads and trackers with user-configurable filter lists (e.g., EasyList, custom hosts files).</li>
            <li><strong>White/Black Lists</strong>: Personalize your browsing by allowing or blocking specific domains.</li>
            <li><strong>DNS Cache</strong>: On-device caching to reduce network traffic and improve performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Statistics</strong>: View insights like the percentage of queries blocked and top blocked domains.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Optimized</strong>: Lightweight design ensures minimal battery and resource usage.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy First</strong>: No tracking, no data collection—just a clean, secure DNS solution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <ol>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
        <h3>How do I configure custom filter lists?</h3>
        <p>In the ADFastDNS app, navigate to the <strong>Filter Lists</strong> section. You can import popular lists like EasyList or upload your own hosts file. Tap "Update" to refresh your lists.</p>

        <h3>Why are some websites not loading correctly?</h3>
        <p>If a website is blocked due to an overly strict filter, you can add it to your <strong>Whitelist</strong> in the app settings to allow access. Alternatively, check your filter lists for potential overblocking.</p>

        <p>Yes, ADFastDNS works on both Wi-Fi and cellular networks, ensuring consistent ad blocking and DNS security across all apps.</p>

        <h3>How can I check blocked queries?</h3>
        <p>Go to the <strong>Statistics</strong> tab in the app to view the percentage of blocked queries and a list of top blocked domains.</p>

        <h3>Is ADFastDNS compatible with my device?</h3>
        <p>ADFastDNS requires iOS 17 or later and is optimized for iPhone and iPad.</p>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App not blocking ads</strong>: Ensure your filter lists are up to date and that ADFastDNS is enabled as your DNS proxy in iOS settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Slow performance</strong>: Verify that your DNS cache is enabled to reduce network traffic. Restart the app if issues persist.</li>
            <li><strong>Connection issues</strong>: Check your internet connection and ensure Cloudflare’s DoH service is operational. Future updates will allow alternative DNS providers.</li>
