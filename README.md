## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How do I configure custom filter lists?
In the ADFastDNS app, navigate to the **Filter Lists** section. You can import popular lists like EasyList or upload your own hosts file. Tap "Update" to refresh your lists.

## Troubleshooting

- **App not blocking ads**: Ensure your filter lists are up to date and that ADFastDNS is enabled as your DNS proxy in iOS settings.

# ADFastDNS Privacy Policy

At ADFastDNS, your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data (or rather, how we don’t) to provide a secure, lightweight, and private DNS proxy and ad-blocking experience. ADFastDNS is designed to protect your browsing without collecting or storing any personal information.

*Effective Date: August 23, 2025*

## Our Commitment to Privacy

ADFastDNS is built with a **zero data collection** philosophy. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information, browsing data, or DNS query logs. Our goal is to provide a clean, secure, and private browsing experience without tracking you or your activities.

## What Data Do We Collect?

**We collect no data.** ADFastDNS operates entirely on your device, processing DNS queries locally. Here’s what this means:

- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect your name, email, IP address, or any other identifiable information.
- **No DNS Query Logs**: Your DNS queries are processed locally and not stored or transmitted to our servers.
- **No Tracking**: We do not use analytics, cookies, or any form of tracking to monitor your activity.
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: Since we collect no data, there’s nothing to share with third parties.

## How ADFastDNS Works

ADFastDNS functions as a DNS proxy and ad blocker, leveraging the following features to ensure privacy and performance:

- **DNS over HTTPS (DoH)**: Queries are encrypted and sent to Cloudflare’s DoH service (configurable providers coming in future updates). We do not intercept or log these queries.
- **On-Device Processing**: All filtering, caching, and blocking occur locally on your device, ensuring no data leaves your iPhone or iPad unless required for DNS resolution.
- **DNS Cache**: Queries are cached locally to reduce network traffic, and cached data is not shared or stored externally.
- **Custom Filter Lists**: You can configure ad-blocking lists (e.g., EasyList) or custom hosts files, which are stored locally and updated at your discretion.

## Third-Party Services

ADFastDNS uses Cloudflare’s DNS over HTTPS (DoH) service to resolve DNS queries securely. We do not control Cloudflare’s infrastructure, but their DoH service is designed to prioritize privacy. Please review [Cloudflare’s Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) for details on their data handling practices. Future updates will allow you to configure alternative DNS providers.

## Statistics and Analytics

The **Statistics** feature in ADFastDNS displays information like the percentage of blocked queries and top blocked domains. This data is generated and stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party.

## Your Choices

- **Filter Lists**: You have full control over which ad-blocking lists to use and can customize whitelists or blacklists to suit your preferences.
- **Clear Cache**: You can clear the on-device DNS cache at any time through the app settings.
- **Disable ADFastDNS**: You can disable ADFastDNS as your DNS proxy via iOS settings if you no longer wish to use it.

## Children’s Privacy

ADFastDNS is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any information from children. Since we collect no data, there is no risk of collecting information from minors.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect new features or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Effective Date" will be updated. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
